# NextBite
NextBite is a React Native App for Android which aims to connect farmers market vendors with non-profit volunteers in order to rescue food and bridge the communication gap. When vendors have food that they want to donate at the end of a market day, whether due to overproduction or visual imperfections, they can use NextBite to create a listing for it. This notifies volunteers that a donation is available in the area. Volunteers can then use NextBite to view the details of the listing, rescue the donation, travel to the market to pick it up, and finally be directed to the nearest non-profit organization to drop it off. Once a volunteer delivers the boxes, the respective vendor is notified of the successful delivery.

## Design
By designing the website in multiple, small sections, users can tap a link in the navigation bar or simply scroll to find the information that they're looking for. By keeping small blocks of text, users can quickly find the information they're looking for without feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information on the page. 

## Purpose
This website lists the important features of our Android application that cater to the needs of our target audiences. It is an informational website that tells users why they should chose our application over the use of another one.
